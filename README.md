# hello!
i'm a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in CS.

i love learning about computers & making things with them!

- 🔭 currently working on: [**nand2tetris**](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), where you make a simplified computer from the bottom up (NAND gates!).

### some things i've made/contributed to

- [**mixtape50**](https://mixtape50.onrender.com), a whimsical website that spells out a message using song titles, as a Spotify playlist (try some samples!)
- [**fullstackopen**](https://github.com/jchanke/fullstackopen), a [full-stack web development course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)  by the University of
  Helsinki.
  
  some project sites I made for this are:
  - [patientor](https://fullstackopen-patientor-ucm1.onrender.com/), a web-app for patient medical records
  - [libary](https://fullstackopen-library.onrender.com/), a library app with authentication—see [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/jchanke/fullstackopen)
    for how!
  - [phonebook](https://fullstackopen-phonebook-ab91.onrender.com/info), a simple personal phonebook
- [**geoquest.gg**](https://geoquest.gg/), an open-source geography guessing game for which [I made a PR to add a new setting](https://github.com/woutdp/geoquest/pull/17). _EDIT:_ it got merged!!
